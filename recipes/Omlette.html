            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1-2 tablespoons milk or cream (optional, for fluffiness)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter or oil</li>

            <li>
                <strong>Prepare the Ingredients:</strong>
                <p>Crack the eggs into a bowl. Add a pinch of salt, pepper, and the milk or cream if using. Whisk until the mixture is smooth and slightly frothy.
                    Prepare your fillings: grate the cheese, dice the vegetables, and chop the cooked meat if using.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Heat the Pan:</strong>
                <p>Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat.
                    Add the butter or oil to the pan, letting it melt and coat the surface evenly.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cook the Eggs:</strong>
                <p>Pour the beaten eggs into the pan, tilting the pan to spread the eggs evenly.
                    Let the eggs cook undisturbed for about 1-2 minutes until the edges start to set but the center is still slightly runny.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Add Fillings and Fold:</strong>
                <p>Gently fold the other half of the omelette over the fillings using a spatula.
                    Cook for another 1-2 minutes, until the cheese is melted and the eggs are fully cooked.
                    Slide the omelette onto a plate and serve hot.</p>
