        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <Strong>Prepare the Dough:</Strong>
                <p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar.
                    Add the yogurt, milk, and 2 tablespoons of melted butter. Mix until the dough starts to come together.
                    Gradually add warm water, a little at a time, kneading the dough until it becomes soft and smooth.
                    Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 30 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <Strong>Divide and Shape the Dough:</Strong>
                <p>After resting, divide the dough into equal-sized balls (about 6-8 balls).
                    Roll each ball out into an oval or round shape, about 1/4-inch thick.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cook the Naan:</strong>
                <p>Heat a skillet or tawa over medium-high heat.
                    Place a rolled-out dough on the hot skillet. Cook for about 1-2 minutes until bubbles start to form on the surface.
                    Flip the naan and cook the other side for another 1-2 minutes until golden brown spots appear.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Brush with Butter:</strong>
                <p>Once cooked, remove the naan from the skillet and brush it with melted butter.
                    Serve hot with your favorite curry or dish.</p>
